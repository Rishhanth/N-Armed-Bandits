# N Armed Bandits
This is an implementation of methods which solve the N armed Bandit problem.  

I have implemented the epsilon greedy and the Upper Confidence Bound algorithms for the same. These are demonstrated in the codes `environment.py` and `environ2.py` respectively where I have tested the algorithms in a 10 arm testbed (as described in the book **Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Sutton R, Barto**)

There are classes implemented for the 2 methods.
